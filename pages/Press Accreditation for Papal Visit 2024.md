<h3><strong>Press Accreditation for Pope Francis’ State Visit to Singapore</strong></h3>
<p>The press accreditation application for the Papal Visit is now open from
9 – 28 Jul 2024. Media personnel who are on assignment with a bona fide
media organisation and wish to participate in the Papal Visit media programme
and access the media centres can apply for press accreditation at <strong><a href="https://go.gov.sg/papalvisit2024media" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/papalvisit2024media</a>.</strong> Applications
are considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>The following details/documents (non-exhaustive) will be required for
application:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Personal details such as full name, nationality and residential address</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A recent colour photograph of yourself against a clear background (in
jpeg format and less than 1MB in size)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Letter of endorsement from media organisation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Media representatives who have been approved for accreditation will be
provided instructions through email on the collection details of their
media passes. Kindly note that the media passes must be displayed prominently
at all times during the Papal Visit. If your media pass is lost or stolen,
you must immediately make a police report and send the scanned police report
to <a href="mailto:papalvisit2024_accreditation@mddi.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">papalvisit2024_accreditation@mddi.gov.sg</a>.
This is to prevent any misuse of the media pass as it is an official pass
to the Papal Visit media programme.</p>
<p>Please note that successful accreditation does not guarantee access to
cover all elements of the Papal Visit media programme. Email instructions
on the media opportunities will be sent separately. Should the number of
interested media personnel exceed venue capacity, or if there are other
operational constraints, media pooling may be exercised.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Digital Development and Information (MDDI)&nbsp;will facilitate
work pass exemption for foreign media successfully accredited to cover
this Papal Visit. For more information, you may visit the Ministry of Manpower's <strong><a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-pass-exempt-activities" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">website</a></strong>.</p>
