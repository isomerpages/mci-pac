<h3><strong>Press Accreditation for Pope Francis’ State Visit to Singapore</strong></h3>
<p>The press accreditation application for the Papal Visit is now open from
9 – 19 Jul 2024. Media personnels who are on assignment with a bona fide
media organisation and wish to participate in the Papal Visit media programme
and access the media centres can apply for press accreditation at <strong><a href="https://go.gov.sg/papalvisit2024media" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/papalvisit2024media</a>.</strong> Applications
are considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>The following details/documents (non-exhaustive) will be required for
application:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Personal details such as full name, nationality and residential address</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A recent colour photograph of yourself against a clear background (in
jpeg format and less than 1MB in size)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Letter of endorsement from media organisation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Media representatives who have been approved for accreditation will be
provided instructions through email on the collection details of their
media passes. Kindly note that the media passes must be displayed prominently
at all times during the Papal Visit. If your media pass is lost or stolen,
you must immediately make a police report and send the scanned police report
to <strong><a href="http://www.go,gov.sg/papalvisit2024media" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">papalvisit2024_accreditation@mddi.gov.sg</a></strong>.
This is to prevent any misuse of the media pass as it is an official pass
to the Papal Visit media programme.</p>
<p>Please note that successful accreditation does not guarantee access to
the Papal Visit media programme. Email instructions on the media opportunities
will be sent separately. Should the number of interested media personnels
exceed venue capacity, media pooling may be exercised.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Digital Development and Information (MDDI)&nbsp; will
facilitate the work pass exemption process only for foreign journalists
who are successfully accredited for the visit. Please note that you will
need to successfully clear customs immigration. For more information, you
may visit the Ministry of Manpower's <strong><a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-pass-exempt-activities" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">website</a></strong>.</p>
