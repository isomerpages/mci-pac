While a journalist does not require press accreditation to report news in Singapore, the Press Accreditation Card (PAC) facilitates his/her job, particularly in securing timely access to information from official government sources.

From time to time, government agencies may issue advance copies of media releases, speeches, and other materials to accredited media to provide them with more time to prepare their stories. Accredited media are expected to reciprocate in the right spirit by:

* Observing the embargo instructions, if any; and
* Checking the materials against delivery

Accredited media organisations and personnel are also expected to accord government agencies the right of reply by carrying in full the government's response to any news reports, letters, op-eds etc, that were published.
