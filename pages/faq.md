### **FAQ**

##### Q1: How long does it take to process a PAC application?

The average processing time of a PAC application is two to four weeks. However, processing may take longer under certain circumstances for e.g. when there is a high volume of applications.

##### Q2: I have received my PAC. Why am I not receiving government press releases or media invitations?

Upon receiving your PAC, please email the MCI Duty Officer at MCI_Duty_Officer@mci.gov.sg to be included into the mailing list to receive government press releases and media invitations.

##### Q3: I am an accredited media personnel in Singapore. I plan to undertake freelance news reporting for other media organisations. Do I need to apply for another PAC?

Each media personnel can only hold one PAC at any point. You cannot use your existing PAC to string for other media organisations.

##### Q4: I have been accredited some time back, but have not been renewing my PAC. Can I renew my PAC now?

You will receive a renewal notification email from MCI 30 days before the expiry of your PAC to remind you to renew your accreditation. If your PAC has expired for more than 90 days, please submit a new application.

##### Q5: I am a journalist based outside of Singapore. Do I need to apply for press accreditation if I plan to travel to Singapore to conduct news reporting?

You do not require accreditation to report news in Singapore. However, you are required to apply for a Miscellaneous Work Pass (MWP) from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). Please refer to the following link for more information: http://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/miscellaneous-work-pass

##### Q6: I am a foreign media personnel to be based in Singapore. I need a PAC urgently but my Employment Pass application has not been approved yet.

You are required to have a valid Employment Pass before you can apply for a PAC. You are required to login using a Singpass when you apply for PAC, for stronger security and better protection on your personal data. For more information on Singpass, please refer to their website (www.singpass.gov.sg). 

##### Q7: Who should I contact if I need a PAC urgently?

Media personnel are reminded to buffer sufficient time for the PAC application process, and to renew their PACs in a timely manner. If you require urgent assistance, please email the MCI Duty Officer at MCI_Duty_Officer@mci.gov.sg .

##### Q8: Why is there a need for a Mass Renewal Exercise every three years?

For security reasons, MCI conducts a mass renewal exercise for PAC once every three years, where all approved PAC applicants will be issued with a PAC of a new design.

##### Q9: Why do I need to submit a police report for a lost PAC?

The PAC is an official pass providing the holder with access to government information and events.  To prevent misuse of the card, MCI would require a police report on record as proof that the card has been lost.
