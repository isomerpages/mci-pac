##### Q2: I have received my PAC. Why am I not receiving government press releases or media invitations?

As soon as you have been accredited, you are required to email a request to our MDDI Duty Officer at MDDI_Duty_Officer@mddi.gov.sg, to be included in the mailing list.

##### Q3: I am an accredited media personnel in Singapore. I plan to undertake freelance news reporting for other media organisations. Do I need to apply for another PAC?

Each media personnel can only hold one PAC at any point. You cannot use your existing PAC to string for other media organisations.

##### Q4: I have been accredited some time back, but have not been renewing my PAC. Can I renew my PAC now?

You will receive a renewal notification email from MDDI 30 days before the expiry of your PAC to remind you to renew your accreditation. If your PAC has expired for more than 90 days, please submit a new application.

##### Q5: I am a journalist based outside of Singapore. Do I need to apply for press accreditation if I plan to travel to Singapore to conduct news reporting?

You do not require accreditation to report news in Singapore. However, you are required to apply for a Miscellaneous Work Pass (MWP) from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). Please refer to the following link for more information: http://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/miscellaneous-work-pass

##### Q6: I am a foreign media personnel to be based in Singapore. I need a PAC urgently but my Employment Pass application has not been approved yet.

You are required to have a valid Employment Pass before you can apply for a PAC. You are required to login using a Singpass when you apply for PAC, for stronger security and better protection on your personal data. For more information on Singpass, please refer to their website (www.singpass.gov.sg). 

##### Q7: Who should I contact if I need a PAC urgently?

Media personnel are reminded to buffer sufficient time for the PAC application process, and to renew their PACs in a timely manner. If you require urgent assistance, please email the MDDI Duty Officer at MDDI_Duty_Officer@mddi.gov.sg .

##### Q8: Why is there a need for a Mass Renewal Exercise every three years?

For security reasons, MDDI conducts a mass renewal exercise for PAC once every three years, where all approved PAC applicants will be issued with a PAC of a new design.

##### Q9: Why do I need to submit a police report for a lost PAC?

As the PAC is an official pass to government events, to prevent any misuse of the card, we would require a police report for our record to prove that it has been reported lost.

##### Q10: Why do I need to login with a SingPass?
Login using SingPass (Singapore Personal Access) is required as it provides stronger security which can better protect your personal data. For more information, please refer to SingPass website (www.singpass.gov.sg).

##### Q11: Why canâ€™t an intern or contract staff apply for a PAC?
We encourage full-fledged journalists to cover the events as interns and contract staff may not be conversant with our guidelines.

The average time taken to process a PAC is between 2 to 4 weeks. However, processing time will be longer during the mass renewal exercise (which will be announced on the website) and certain government events.

##### Q13: What is a Business Registration Number or UEN?
UEN or Unique Entity Number is a standard identification number for entities to interact with government agencies. Depending on its nature, an entity may obtain a UEN by registering itself with an appropriate UEN issuance agency as listed in www.uen.gov.sg.
